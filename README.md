### Description
This Node.js OCR (Optical Character Recognition) project allows for recognizing and extracting text from images. It leverages the Tesseract.js library for text recognition and Sharp for image preprocessing. The API is built using Express and Multer to handle image uploads.

### Installation
Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system before proceeding with the steps below:
git clone https://github.com/example/nodejs-ocr-project.git
cd nodejs-ocr-project
npm install

### Usage
To start the server, use the following command in your terminal:
node server.js

Once the server is running, you can upload images by sending a POST request to http://localhost:3000/upload with the key as image and the value as the image file you wish to recognize. Use Postman or a similar tool for convenience.
